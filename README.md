## Description

_The goal of this simple Web page is to **keep track of your winning score**when playing games like_,<br/>
_Tic Tac Toe', Ping Pong', Rock Paper Scissors', whatever you're playing with your friend_.<br/>
_Two players: player 1 score; player two score. You load up the page and it tells us we're playing to five_.<br/>
_And so all we do is add a point by clicking on a button_.<br/>
_So to add a point to Player 1 we click on Player 1 if we want to add a point player 2, click on Player 2_,<br/>
_and then who ever gets to five, it turns green. There's a winner and if somebody tries to score again it can't_.<br/>
_That's because the game is over. So to start a new game it's necessary reset by clicking the reset button.
